- ⚡ Fun fact: The @ sign was already in use in the Middle Ages - long before emails!
               Merchants used it in the 16th century as an abbreviation for the unit of measurement “at the rate of” (e.g. 10 apples @ 1 shilling). 
               The computer scientist Ray Tomlinson chose it for email addresses in 1971 because it does not appear in any name
               and was therefore perfect for separating user name and domain.
